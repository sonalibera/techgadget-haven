Project Summary: TechGadget Haven
Project Title: TechGadget Haven - E-commerce Product Page

Objective:
The goal of this project was to create a fully functional e-commerce product page named "TechGadget Haven," where users can browse tech gadgets, add them to a shopping cart, and simulate a checkout process. The project focuses on providing a seamless user experience across different devices, ensuring responsiveness and ease of use.

Key Features:

Product Display:

The main product page (index.html) showcases five tech gadgets, each with detailed information, including images, price, description, and customer reviews.
Users can select the quantity of a product they wish to purchase and add it to their cart.
Add-to-Cart Functionality:

JavaScript (scripts.js) handles adding products to the cart, updating the cart total dynamically, and storing cart data in the browser's local storage.
The cart's total number of items is displayed in the header for easy access.
Shopping Cart Management:

A dedicated cart page (cart.html) allows users to view and manage the items they have added to their cart.
Users can see the total number of items in their cart and proceed to checkout.
Checkout Simulation:

Upon clicking the "Proceed to Checkout" button, a checkout process is simulated by clearing the cart and redirecting the user to an order confirmation page (order-confirmation.html).
The order confirmation page thanks the user for their purchase and provides an option to continue shopping.
Responsive Design:

The entire project is designed to be responsive and optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience on both desktops and mobile devices.
CSS (styles.css) is used to style the pages, with media queries ensuring that the layout adapts to smaller screens.
Technologies Used:

HTML: For structuring the web pages and content.
CSS: For styling the pages and ensuring a responsive design.
JavaScript: For implementing the add-to-cart functionality, cart management, and checkout simulation.
Local Storage: To persist cart data across page reloads.
Deployment:
The project can be deployed using any static site hosting service like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel. The deployment will allow users to interact with the e-commerce product page and experience the full shopping flow, from browsing products to simulating a purchase.

Conclusion:
The "TechGadget Haven" project successfully implements a basic e-commerce workflow, providing a solid foundation for further enhancements, such as integrating with a backend for actual payment processing and order management. The project demonstrates core web development skills, including front-end design, responsive layouts, and interactive user experiences.
